abstract: This article examines the prevalence of research techniques in the Brazilian Political Science empirical research based on content analysis of 3,409 abstracts published in six important journals from 1993 to 2019. In addition, we present a brief inventory of research tools commonly used in both quantitative and qualitative research. The main results of the statistical survey indicate that: the number of words referring to causal inference has increased significantly over time, from 1 in 1993 to 6 in 2019; comparatively, the use of quantitative and qualitative research techniques has grown with nearly the same rate; and however, qualitative research designs are strongly restricted to the use of interviews. With this paper, we hope to spread research methods more generally and to contribute to initiatives specially designed to improve the methodological training of Brazilian political scientists.
