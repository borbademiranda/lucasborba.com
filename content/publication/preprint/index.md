abstract: Much of what we know about public support for democracy is based on survey questions about “democracy,” a term that varies in meaning across countries and likely prompts uncritically supportive responses. This paper proposes a new approach to measuring support for democracy. We develop a battery of 17 survey questions that cover all eight components of liberal democracy as defined by the V-Dem project. We then ask respondents from 19 national samples to evaluate these rights and institutions. We find considerable heterogeneity across countries in how our items cohere, especially in less developed contexts. Yet, those items that are more weakly connected with general support for liberal democracy tend to reveal the influence of political events and actors, arguably indicating weaknesses in political cultures. We further identify a concise subset of seven items that provide a reliable and valid measure of support for liberal democracy across our different samples.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper introduces a new way to measure support for democracy by using 17 survey items tied to the eight components of liberal democracy from V-Dem, tested across 19 countries. The results show cross-national variation in how these items relate to each other, with weaker connections often reflecting the impact of political events and actors. The authors also identify a shorter set of seven questions that reliably captures support for liberal democracy across diverse contexts.
