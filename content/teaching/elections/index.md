### Description

As one scholar observed, elections are the instruments of democracy. Across the world, citizens in democratic systems vote to choose their leaders. What electoral rules structure this process, and how do they shape representation? Who votes, why do they participate, and what influences their choices? How do candidates and campaigns seek to sway voters? These questions lie at the heart of political science and form the core of this course.
