### Description

This course explores major themes in African politics and development. Moving chronologically, we examine the pre-colonial, colonial, post-colonial, and “third wave” transitions to democracy, highlighting the political and socioeconomic legacies each period left behind. We consider questions such as: How did the slave trade shape African societies? Why was colonialism in Africa so late and short-lived? How did independence movements give way to authoritarian regimes? What explains the push toward democracy, and has it taken root since founding elections?
